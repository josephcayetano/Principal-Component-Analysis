# Principal Component Analysis
### Overview
This project used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with regression to predict housing prices. The goal was to reduce the number of features while keeping most of the important information. This helped improve model performance and made the results easier to understand.

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA) + Regression
-	Used PCA to reduce 14 features down to 10 main components, keeping about 87% of the original data’s variation
-	Built a regression model using these components to fix multicollinearity and make the model simpler
-	Improved the model through stepwise optimization, reaching an R² of around 0.64 on both training and test sets
